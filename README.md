# Portfolio
üóÉÔ∏è**3 of the Main Portfolio Projects** from using Python and Advanced Data Analytics

**1. Credit Risk Modeling - PD Model and Application Scorecard Development:**
Problem Statement: Developed a credit risk model to assess borrower default probability, aiding in data-driven lending decisions.
Methodology: Implemented a Logistic Regression model for probability of default (PD) prediction, and created an application scorecard to streamline risk evaluation.
Tools: Python, relevant libraries (Scikit-learn, likely others for specific metrics)
Validation: Rigorously evaluated model performance using Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Gini Coefficient, and KS Statistic.
Monitoring: Calculated Population Stability Index (PSI) to assess model robustness over time and identify the need for recalibration.

**2. Data-Driven Insights & Predictive Modeling - Employee Retention Strategies Model:**
Problem Statement: Analyzed HR data to identify factors contributing to employee attrition, aiding in the development of data-driven retention strategies.
Tools & Methods: Utilized Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn for data cleaning, exploration, and predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Results: XGBoost Model achieved high model performance with accuracy of around 96%, extracted actionable insights on key attrition drivers such as overwork and lack of recognition and recommendations on capping projects, addressing promotion timelines, and clarifying overtime policies.

**3. Time Series Forecasting - Real GDP Forecasting Model:**
Problem Statement: Developed an advanced time series forecasting model to predict quarterly US real GDP, incorporating exogenous variables to enhance prediction accuracy.
Tools & Methods: Utilized Python (Statsmodels) for data manipulation, SARIMAX model implementation, and evaluation.
Data: US macroeconomic dataset (1959-2009), demonstrating the ability to work with real-world, complex data.
Results: Achieved a MAPE of 0.70%, demonstrating strong forecasting performance and outperforming a baseline model by 0.04%

Also there are other small projects that helped me to get more proficient in the field of Analytics. Currently more projects related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning to expand my horizons in the field and solve important yet complex business problems.
