**100** - It is notes on specific concepts of machine learning covering from Pandas data frames(Data Processing) to supervised and unsupervised machine learning models(Data Analytics).

**101**- It is the capstone project from Google - "Advanced Analytics Professional Certification".
        - Analyzed HR data to diagnose high employee turnover; identified strain from excessive projects and imbalanced evaluations.
        - Developed a predictive model to gauge attrition likelihood, leading to actionable strategies for improved retention.
        - Recommended data-driven policy refinements, including project caps and evaluation criteria revamps.


**102** - It is a fun project about web scraping the top 1000 movies from imdb and analysing the data based on the movie geek interests. 
        - Using Web Scraping techniques in Python, pulled the top 1000 movies metadata from web
        - Processed the data for further analysis
        - Analyzed the data and generated various insights


**103** - It is an ongoing project of credit risk modelling along with developing a credit scorecard
        - Goal: Developing a data-driven credit risk model in Python to predict probabilities of default (PD) and create credit scorecards for existing and potential borrowers using lending club company's peer-to
          peer (P2P) loans data.

**120** - It is portfolio optimization of a stock portfolio based on modern portfolio theory and efficient frontier construction to plot the optimal portfolio combination
        - Applied Mean-Variance Optimization to construct an optimal asset allocation model for a NIFTY100 stock portfolio, aiming for best risk-adjusted returns.
        - Analyzed historical data and developed an efficiency frontier for further optimization.
